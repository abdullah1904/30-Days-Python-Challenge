<h1 align="center">30 Days Python Challenge</h1>
<h2>Day 3 (Operators)</h1>
<h3>Exercises:</h3>
<p>1. Declare your age as integer variable</p>

```py
```

<p>2. Declare your height as a float variable</p>

```py
```

<p>3. Declare a variable that store a complex number</p>

```py
```

<p>4. Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).</p>

```py
```

<p>5. Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).</p>

```py
```

<p>6. Get length and width of a rectangle using prompt. Calculate its area (area = length x width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))</p>

```py
```

<p>7. Get radius of a circle using prompt. Calculate the area (area = pi x r x r) and circumference (c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.</p>

```py
```

<p>8. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2</p>

```py
```

<p>9. Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope and Euclidean distance between point (2, 2) and point (6,10)</p>

```py
```

<p>10. Compare the slopes in tasks 8 and 9.</p>

```py
```

<p>11. Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is going to be 0.</p>

```py
```

<p>12. Find the length of 'python' and 'dragon' and make a falsy comparison statement.</p>

```py
```

<p>13. Use and operator to check if 'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'</p>

```py
```

<p>14. I hope this course is not full of jargon. Use in operator to check if jargon is in the sentence.</p>

```py
```

<p>15. There is no 'on' in both dragon and python</p>
<p>16. Find the length of the text python and convert the value to float and convert it to string</p>
<p>17. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check if a number is even or not using python?</p>
<p>18. Check if the floor division of 7 by 3 is equal to the int converted value of 2.7</p>
<p>19. Check if type of '10' is equal to type of 10</p>
<p>20. Check if int('9.8') is equal to 10</p>
<p>21. Write a script that prompts the user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person</p>
<p>22. Write a script that prompts the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume a person can live hundred years</p>
<p>23. Write a Python script that displays the following table<br/>
1 1 1 1 1<br/>
2 1 2 4 8<br>
3 1 3 9 27<br>
4 1 4 16 64<br>
5 1 5 25 125</p>
